# 📊 Monitoring (daemon)

## 📌 Description

Collecting system and application metrics on the node: CPU, RAM, disk, network, GPU, Docker and systemd state. Metrics are available through the CLI and the daemon API, and are streamed to the platform for the dashboard and alerts.

## 🎯 Scenarios

- `asc status` — a server and application summary in the terminal.
- `asc stats` — CPU, memory, disk usage and I/O, and network I/O per application (like `docker stats --no-stream`); `asc stats --live` keeps refreshing in place instead of exiting after one sample (like plain `docker stats`); root sees all users' applications grouped by owner.
- The platform dashboard shows node load graphs in real time.
- An "application went down" alert → a Telegram notification (via the platform).
- The AI assistant answers "what's eating my memory?" with monitoring data.

## 🏗️ Technical design

- **System metrics**: CPU, memory, disk (usage + I/O), network (rx/tx, errors, drops), GPU — directly from procfs (`/proc/stat`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/loadavg`, `/proc/net/dev`, `/proc/uptime`) and `statvfs(3)` for disks; no external crates. Nothing distro-specific here; a separate collector behind the same abstraction will come later for macOS.
- **Application metrics**: per-container stats (Docker API), per-unit (systemd cgroups), per-process.
- **Network interfaces**: an interface list (IP, MAC, status, speed, type), traffic statistics; interface management is post-MVP.
- **Storage**: a ring buffer in memory + a short history in SQLite; long history lives on the platform side.
- **Delivery**: a push stream into the nodeservice tunnel (5–15 s interval, adaptive); healthcheck events — instantly.
- **Application health statuses**: `running / stopped / unhealthy / unknown` — based on the healthcheck from `asc.yaml`.

### 🧩 Implementation (current increment)

- The `src/daemon/monitor/` module: `system.rs` — procfs parsers (pure functions over `&str`, covered by unit tests) and snapshot capture; `mod.rs` — `Monitor`: a background sampler in the daemon; the interval and history depth are set in `config.toml` (`[monitor] interval_ms = 100`, `history_samples = 300` — 30 s of in-memory history at 100 ms). The old `interval_secs` key from configs written before DMN-072 is still parsed so those files load, but it no longer sets the interval and is never written back — it disappears from `config.toml` on the next save (DMN-075). Honouring it was why an updated daemon could still deliver one sample per 10 s: every install older than DMN-072 carries `interval_secs = 10`.
- **Live stream (DMN-072)**: `Monitor` holds a `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel; every `push()` fans the sample out to subscribers (capacity 16 — a receiver that falls behind just skips ahead on `Lagged` rather than blocking the sampler). `MonitorService.StreamSystemMetrics` subscribes to the channel instead of being polled by `GetSystemMetrics` — the platform panel gets frames as fast as the daemon actually samples them. The subscription is taken before the buffer is read, and the sample already in the buffer is sent as the first frame (DMN-075), so a panel that just connected paints at once instead of waiting out a sampling interval.
- CPU usage is computed as the delta of two `/proc/stat` reads; network rates (bytes/s) — as counter deltas between samples.
- **GPU metrics**: `gpu.rs` — one entry per card (vendor, model, utilisation, VRAM used/total, temperature, power). NVIDIA comes from `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=... --format=csv,noheader,nounits`: the proprietary driver exposes no kernel interface with utilisation, so the vendor tool — shipped with every driver package — is the only portable source; the call is bounded by a 5 s timeout and the child is killed if it hangs. AMD comes from the `amdgpu` sysfs interface (`gpu_busy_percent`, `mem_info_vram_total`/`_used`, `hwmon/*/temp1_input`, `power1_average`), read like every other metric here. Sources are **probed once**: a machine with no GPU never spawns a process again, and its `gpus` list simply stays empty. Because a sample may spawn a process, the daemon's sampler runs the whole collection on a blocking thread.
- **API**: `MonitorService` in proto (`GetSystemMetrics`, `GetMetricsHistory`) + REST routes `GET /v1/metrics` and `GET /v1/metrics/history?limit=N` — both transports on top of the shared layer, like the rest of the API (DMN-005).
- **CLI**: `asc status` shows CPU (usage, load average), memory, disks and — when there is one — every GPU (model, utilisation, VRAM) — the metrics are sampled by the CLI itself without contacting the daemon (autonomy).
- **Per-app metrics**: the `usage()` method on the `AppDriver` trait returns cumulative counters (CPU time in microseconds, resident memory in bytes, block-device read/write bytes, network rx/tx bytes — the I/O counters are `Option`, `None` when the runtime cannot report them); sources by runtime — the Docker Engine API (`/containers/<id>/stats`, one-shot: `blkio_stats.io_service_bytes_recursive` for disk I/O, `networks` for network I/O, both real because a container has its own cgroup and network namespace), the systemd unit's cgroup v2 (`cpu.stat` + `memory.current` + `io.stat` for disk I/O; network I/O is always `None` — a unit shares the host's network namespace, so there is nothing per-unit to read), `/proc/<pid>/stat` + `statm` + `io` for processes (disk I/O from `read_bytes`/`write_bytes`; network I/O always `None` for the same reason as systemd). CPU% is computed as the delta of two samples (~500 ms), like `docker stats`, and can exceed 100% on multi-core machines.
- **CLI `asc stats`**: an ID / KIND / CPU % / MEM / QUOTA / DISK / NET/s / DISK/s / NET I/O / DISK I/O table over running applications — QUOTA is a compact usage bar (like `asc app disk`) when the app has a disk quota set, else a dash, DISK is the app directory's total size regardless; NET/s and DISK/s are the current throughput ("rx/s / tx/s" and "read/s / write/s"), the delta of the same two samples the CPU% comes from; NET I/O and DISK I/O are "rx / tx" and "read / write" cumulative byte totals since the app started (like `docker stats`'s own NET I/O / BLOCK I/O columns — not a rate); all four are a dash when the runtime cannot report the pair (network is only available for Docker apps, see above); sorting `--sort cpu|mem` (cpu by default); for root — grouping by owner, like `asc app list`. Stopped applications are shown with dashes. `--live` reprints the same table in place (screen clear + redraw) every ~500 ms — the same interval a single sample already costs for the CPU delta, so no extra sleep — until Ctrl+C.
- Next increments: per-app metrics in the API (`MonitorService`), history in SQLite, healthcheck statuses, pushing into the tunnel.
