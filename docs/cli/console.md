# 🖥️ WebSocket application console (daemon)

## 📌 Description

The daemon exposes a WebSocket console for a specific application: a terminal and live log stream in the browser (attach to a container or to a native application's journal).

## 🎯 Scenarios

- 🧑‍💻 A developer opens the application's "Console" tab — sees live output and types commands into the application's stdin (e.g. a Minecraft server console).
- 🔎 In the "Logs" tab they find the moment of a crash using timestamps and a filter.

## 🏗️ Technical design

### 🖥️ Application tabs in the UI

Every application in the platform has two tabs:

- **Console** — real time: a stream of the Docker application's output or the native application's runtime process; **at the bottom — an input line for the application's stdin**. This is an interactive session (attach), not just viewing.
- **Logs** — history: **every line carries a timestamp**, text search/filtering, sorting by time, range selection; a "show in context" jump from a search result.

### 🎨 Terminal

The terminal is modern and convenient: xterm.js, **full ANSI color support** and control sequences, automatic sizing (resize → PTY), copy/paste, buffer search, scrollback history, font/theme selection (inherits the UI theme).

### ⚙️ Transport

- **WebSocket console**: a server inside the daemon; sessions `logs` (a read-only stream: docker logs -f / journald follow, with timestamps), `attach` (the application's PTY/stdin, bidirectional) and `exec` (an independent shell inside the application, DMN-082 — see below). The protocol is binary frames (stdin/stdout/resize) as in ttyd/gotty.
- **Access via a temporary token**: a WebSocket connection to the console opens **only with a temporary token**, issued **through the daemon API** (`AppService.IssueConsoleToken` / `POST /v1/apps/{id}/console-token`): TTL 30 seconds, single-use, bound to the application and the session type `logs`/`attach`/`exec`. An `exec` grant additionally carries the command to run (empty = probe for a shell, see below). The platform obtains the token automatically when the console tab opens (the backend checks permissions → requests a token from the daemon → hands it to the browser); in standalone mode the CLI issues it (`asc app console-token <id>`).
- **Endpoint**: `GET /v1/console?token=<token>[&tail=N][&cols=N&rows=N]` — outside the API's bearer authentication (a browser cannot set headers on a WS handshake); the only protection is the single-use token; an invalid/used token → 401 before the upgrade. `cols`/`rows` set the initial PTY geometry for an `exec` session (default 80×24 until the client's first resize frame); ignored by `logs`/`attach`.
- **MVP implementation (DMN-007)**: the `logs` session — text frames, source by runtime: for Docker — **log streaming via the Engine API** (`follow` + timestamps over the unix socket); for systemd — `journalctl -f -o short-iso`; for process — `tail -F app.log` (the subprocess is killed when the client disconnects). The `attach` session — Docker only for now (**Engine API `attach`**, binary stdin/stdout frames); systemd/process need a PTY at launch — that arrives with the ttyd-style binary protocol (resize etc.) during the UI work (FE-006).
- **`exec` session (DMN-082)**: an interactive shell inside a Docker container, independent of `attach` — it does not join the console hub and is never fanned out to other viewers; each `exec` connection gets its own process via the Engine API (`create_exec` + `start_exec` with a PTY, `attach_stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr`). If the token's command is empty, the daemon probes `/bin/bash` then falls back to `/bin/sh` — whichever exists in the image. Frames in both directions are **tagged binary**, one leading byte matching the platform relay's `wsapi/protocol.go` byte-for-byte: `0x00` = data (the raw stdin/stdout payload follows), `0x01` = resize, client→daemon only (a 4-byte payload: big-endian `cols` then `rows`), applied via the Engine API's `resize_exec`. An unrecognized tag is dropped rather than failing the connection. `exec` is Docker-only for now; systemd/process report the same "not supported yet" error as `attach`. Known limitation: the Engine API's exec has no kill — an abrupt socket drop leaves the daemon only able to close stdin, not force the process to exit; documented here rather than worked around, since a proper fix needs Docker to support it.
- **Multiple connections to one application** (tabs/users): `attach` sessions are multi-client following the wings pattern — the daemon creates **one shared source session** (hub) per application and its output is fanned out to all connections via a broadcast channel; a lagging client loses old chunks but does not slow down the rest. The hub keeps a **replay buffer** of the last ~128 KiB of output — a new tab immediately sees recent output, and all clients' stdin converges into the container's single pipe. The source (Engine API `attach`) closes together with the last client. `logs` sessions are independent by construction: every connection is its own follow stream with its own `tail`, so multiple tabs work there too.
- **CLI**: `asc attach <id>` (synonym `asc app attach <id>`) — an interactive application console right from the server terminal: the CLI process's stdin/stdout are piped into the application. With a daemon running it goes **through the daemon's own console** (DMN-043): the CLI asks for a console token over the unix socket and opens the same WebSocket session the browser uses, so a regular user needs neither membership in the `docker` group nor access to the root-owned app tree — the peer uid the daemon reads from the socket is the whole authorization. Without a daemon (standalone install) the CLI goes straight to the Engine API instead. Either way Docker fans the output out to everyone attached (CLI + browser tabs). Docker applications only for now; systemd/process — together with PTY (FE-006). Disconnect — Ctrl+C, the application keeps running.
- **Routing**: browser ↔ nodeservice (wss) ↔ daemon tunnel ↔ console module.
- **Permissions**: `apps.console` controls access to the application console ([🔐 access-control](https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-platform/blob/main/docs/features/access-control.md)).
