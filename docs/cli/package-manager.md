# 📦 Package manager and registries

## 📌 Description

A package manager in the spirit of apt/homebrew: applications are described by an `asc.yaml` manifest, published in registries and installed with `asc install <package>`. Registries can be official or custom, local (`file://`) or remote (`https://`), including GitHub repositories.

## 🎯 Scenarios

- `asc install nginx` — install from the official registry.
- `asc source add https://registry.example.com` — connect a custom registry (like an apt source).
- `asc source add https://github.com/user/my-app` — an application straight from GitHub (asc.yaml at the root); for a private repo a 404 triggers an offer to configure a token.
- `asc install https://github.com/user/my-app --branch dev` — install directly from a repository URL, no registry involved at all (DMN-040): a one-off, for forks and packages that were never published. `asc source add` above wires a repo into the registry system permanently; this is for trying one out.
- The platform store ([🛍️ app-store](https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-platform/blob/main/docs/features/app-store.md)) is a storefront over the same registries.

## 🏗️ Technical design

### The asc.yaml manifest (draft)

```yaml
name: my-app
version: 1.2.0
type: docker | native | utility
category: web                 # a registry topic (databases, ai, bots, game-servers…)
description: "..."            # EN in the official registry
settings: ./asc.settings.yaml # optional: the application settings file (see below)
runtime:
  image: nginx:1.27           # for docker
  stdin: true                 # docker, optional: keep stdin open (docker run -i) — `asc attach` input reaches the app
  tty: true                   # docker, optional: allocate a pseudo-TTY (docker run -t)
  # or install/start/stop commands for native
requirements: { ram: 256M, disk: 1G }
healthcheck: { http: /health }
```

> ℹ️ The manifest has **no `env:`, `ports:` or `volumes:` sections** (DMN-027/030): environment variables, published ports and volumes are all declared in `asc.settings.yaml` — settings with an `env:` key and the `ports` / `volumes` setting types (see below). One source of truth: what the user can configure is exactly what the app gets.

> ℹ️ Every `type: docker` container gets a raised open-files limit (`ulimit nofile`, 10240 soft/hard) instead of the Engine's own default of 1024 — several game servers (7 Days to Die's EOS SDK is the documented case) hang or crash during startup on that default with no clearer symptom than the process going silent after its first log line.

#### 🏗️ Local image build: `image-build` (DMN-050)

A `type: docker` app can ship its own **Dockerfile** and have the Engine build the image locally instead of (or beside) pulling a prebuilt one:

```yaml
runtime:
  image-build:
    context: .              # build context dir, relative to the manifest (default '.')
    dockerfile: Dockerfile  # relative to the context (default 'Dockerfile')
    args:                   # optional --build-arg values
      VERSION: "1.0"
    tag: asc-local/my-app   # optional; default 'asc-local/<app>:latest'
```

- **Only `image`** → pull it, as before.
- **Only `image-build`** → build the image from the package Dockerfile at install (and rebuild it on upgrade / a settings-drift recreate; layer caching keeps this cheap). The build context is packed from the package repository and never reaches outside it.
- **Both `image` and `image-build`** → the installer offers a **choice**: interactively `asc install <app>` prints the two options and asks; non-interactively (or to skip the prompt) pass **`--image`** (pull the prebuilt one) or **`--build`** (build locally). The chosen source is recorded in `meta.json` so a later recreate or upgrade uses the same one without asking again.

> ⚠️ The build runs as the daemon (root). Until per-user container policy lands (DMN-043), building is intended for trusted packages; the base image referenced by `FROM` is pulled by the Engine anonymously (private base images for a local build are a later increment).

The build always goes through the Engine's **BuildKit** backend, not the legacy builder — Dockerfile syntax such as `COPY --chmod`/`--chown` needs it, and the legacy builder fails with "the --chmod option requires BuildKit" otherwise. Progress comes from BuildKit's own trace (the Engine sends no `docker build`-style text lines over the API — rendering them is the client's job): on a terminal each build step gets a spinner bar, numbered in start order and frozen on `cached` / `done <secs>` / `error: …`, with byte counts underneath while a layer is being pulled, regardless of the log level. The same steps, their sub-statuses and the steps' own output go to the log, which is what a non-interactive caller — the daemon, a script — sees instead.

> ⚠️ **Where the progress actually appears.** With the service running, `asc install` is executed by the **daemon** (DMN-042): a single request that returns once the install is over. The build therefore happens in the daemon's process, where stderr is the journal and not a terminal — **no bars can appear in the CLI**, which shows a spinner for the duration. The build's progress is in the daemon's log: `journalctl -u asc -f`. Each step reaching a terminal state (`cached` / `done <secs>` / `error: …`) is logged at **info** level, so it is visible without enabling debug; the noisier half (steps starting, byte counters, each step's own output) needs `sudo asc config debug on` **plus** `sudo asc service restart` — the daemon reads its level from `/etc/asc/config.toml` at startup. `RUST_LOG=asc_daemon=trace` on the service dumps every raw frame of the Engine's build stream. A build that finishes without a single BuildKit trace frame logs a warning naming that fact — that state means the build ran blind rather than that nothing happened. Bars in the terminal are for the standalone path only (no daemon installed, or root falling back with the service down).

### Application settings: asc.settings.yaml

Application settings live in a separate file referenced from `asc.yaml` (`settings: ./asc.settings.yaml`). It describes the parameters: type, limits, enumerations, defaults — the user fills them in at install time (the platform UI renders a form, the CLI asks questions; silent mode takes the defaults):

```yaml
settings:
  - key: server_name
    type: string                # string | number | boolean | enum | secret
    title: "Server name"
    default: "My Server"
    required: true
    env: SERVER_NAME            # exposed to the app as this env variable

  - key: max_players
    type: number
    default: 10
    limits: { min: 1, max: 200 }   # value limits

  - key: difficulty
    type: enum                  # an enumeration
    values: [peaceful, easy, normal, hard]
    default: normal

  - key: game_version
    type: enum                  # presets, but a custom value is also accepted
    values: [public, latest_experimental]
    default: public
    allow_custom: true           # any other branch/build id is accepted as-is

  - key: rcon_password
    type: secret                # stored as a secret, masked
    required: true

  - key: enable_backups
    type: boolean
    default: true

  - key: game_port
    type: ports                 # published ports (a list)
    default: [27015]
    limits: { min: 1024, max: 65535 }
    env: CS2_PORT               # exposed comma-joined; one port — as is
    protocol: both               # tcp (default) | udp | both

  - key: http_port
    type: ports                 # the value is the HOST side, user-chosen
    default: [8080]
    container: [3000]           # the CONTAINER side, fixed by the author
    limits: { min: 1024, max: 65535 }
    env: PORT                   # exposes 3000 — where the app must listen

  - key: game_data
    type: volumes               # app volumes (a list, forms below)
    default: [/home/steam/cs2-dedicated]
```

- Setting values are saved in `/asc/apps/<id>/config/settings.json` (0600 — the file may hold secrets); at install time it is seeded with the defaults, an upgrade adds defaults for new keys without touching the user's choices.
- **Env pass-through**: every setting that declares `env: VAR_NAME` lands in the application's environment (secrets included — that is what their `env:` is for). For Docker apps the variables go into the container env at creation. List values (`ports`, `volumes`) are exposed comma-joined.
- **`type: ports`** — the ports the app publishes. The setting's value is the **host** side — the port the user picks and connects to. **`protocol`** picks the transport(s) to forward: `tcp` (default), `udp`, or `both` (the same port on TCP and UDP).
- **`container:` (type: ports only, DMN-052)** — the **container** side, fixed by the package author: where the app listens *inside* the container, which is a property of the image, not a user choice. Written as one port (`container: 3000`) or a list (`container: [3000, 3443]`) paired **by index** with the setting's value, so the author also fixes how many ports the app publishes — the editor rejects a value with a different count. Without `container:` the publish stays host == container, which is what every package written before this field does, and nothing about them changes.
  - **`env:` exposes the container side.** The variable tells the app where to listen, and the publish points at it: with `container: [3000]` and a user-chosen host port of 8080, `env: PORT` is `PORT=3000` and the Engine publishes `8080 → 3000`. When there is no `container:`, both sides are the same number anyway. An app that must advertise its *public* port has host == container by nature (game servers, SIP) — declare it without `container:`.
  - Two settings may share a port number only on different transports (`3000/tcp` and `3000/udp`); pointing two settings at the same container port and transport is refused, because the Engine would keep just one of the two publishes.
- **`type: volumes`** — the app's volumes; every entry takes one of three forms:
  - `/container/path` — private app data: the app's **data folder** (`/asc/apps/<id>/data`) is mounted at that container path. The folder is created world-writable (0777): images run under arbitrary non-root users and bind mounts keep host ownership; the app directory above it stays restrictive. When the image declares a numeric `USER uid:gid`, the folder is also chowned to it (DMN-038) — a non-root process may only chown a path it already owns, so an image that `chown`s its own data directory on first start (not just writes to it) needs this to avoid EPERM; a named (`steam`) or bare-uid `USER` is left as world-writable only, since its group is only known to the image's own `/etc/passwd`;
  - `/container/path:host` — same, but the host side after the colon is used **instead of `data`**: a plain folder name lands inside the app directory (`/asc/apps/<id>/<folder>`; `repository`, `config` and `meta.json` are reserved), an **absolute path** is a host machine path mounted verbatim (a pre-existing directory keeps its ownership and mode);
  - `name:/container/path[:ro|:rw]` — a Docker **named volume**, created by the Engine on first use. Named volumes are how several apps share data: one app writes the volume, others mount it `:ro` (see the cs2 stack in [asc-example-apps](https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-example-apps)). Named volumes are not removed with the app.
- **Applying changes**: a container's configuration is fixed at creation, so on the next `asc app start` / `asc app restart` the daemon compares the desired state — env, published ports, volumes, quota, start command — with the container's actual one and **recreates the container** when they differ (or when the container is missing). App data lives in volumes and survives the recreate. If the desired state cannot be computed (say, the registry source is gone), the app still starts as is — availability wins, with a warning in the log.
- Changing settings — **`asc app settings <id>`**: an interactive editor in the terminal. It first shows the **categories** — `environments` (string/number/boolean/enum/secret settings), `ports`, `volumes`, `quota`, `start_command` — then the settings of the picked category: pick one by number, enter a value, and it is validated against the definition (type, `limits`, enum `values`; secrets are masked in the list; ports and volumes take space-separated lists). Also via the platform UI. After a change the application is restarted (`asc app restart <id>`). With a daemon running, the editor reads the schema and the values **from the daemon** and writes them back the same way (DMN-043), so it works for a regular user whose app lives in the root-owned system tree; the daemon validates every value against that app's own schema before it lands in `settings.json`. Without a daemon the CLI edits the file directly, as before.
- **`allow_custom` (type: enum only)** — accepts any value outside the declared `values` list as free text, instead of rejecting it. Use it for enums that list common presets but should not lock the user out of a value the author didn't anticipate (a game branch/build id, a custom world name). The numbered picker in `asc app settings` still lists the presets; typing anything else is simply accepted.
- **API access** (DMN-078): `GET`/`PUT /v1/apps/{id}/settings` over the daemon's REST API, and the equivalent `AppService.GetAppSettings`/`SetAppSettings` over gRPC — the same values as the CLI editor, `values_json`/`values` as a JSON object rather than `google.protobuf.Struct` (which would turn an integer like a port into a double). A write returns `restart_required: true` when the app is currently running and its live configuration would now drift from the saved values — the caller should offer `asc app restart <id>` (or the platform's own restart action); a stopped app always answers `false`, since its values simply apply on the next start.

#### 🧭 First-time setup: the `setup` block (DMN-138)

A package author can declare a **first-time setup questionnaire** — questions the platform puts to the operator while the app is being installed. Each question is about one environment variable, i.e. about a setting from `settings` (types `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `enum`, `secret`; `ports`/`volumes` are lists the questionnaire does not edit). Type, limits, allowed values, default and `env` all come from that setting, so an answer is simply the setting's value and travels the usual `settings.json` → container env pipeline.

```yaml
settings:
  - key: server_name
    type: string
    env: SERVER_NAME
    default: "My Server"
  - key: admin_password
    type: secret
    env: ADMIN_PASSWORD
setup:
  title: First-time setup             # optional
  description: A couple of questions before the first start   # optional
  questions:
    - setting: admin_password         # a setting key from settings
      question: Choose the admin password          # defaults to the setting's title
      hint: You will need it to sign in to the admin panel   # defaults to its description
      required: true                  # the app will not start without an answer
    - setting: server_name            # required: false — may be skipped and set later
```

- **Package checks**: `setup` needs at least one question; a question points at an existing setting of a suitable type; one setting is asked at most once. A violation is an `asc.settings.yaml` read error, like the file's other checks.
- **Required questions** (`required: true`): while such a setting has no answer — no value, `null`, or an empty/blank string — `asc app start`/`restart` (CLI, REST, gRPC) refuse with a clear error: `SetupIncomplete` → gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, REST `409` with `setup_incomplete: { app, settings }`. A package default counts as an answer — which is why required questions normally have none: that is the point of asking (a password, a token, a license key). The check is best effort: an unreadable manifest or settings file does not block the start (the start itself reports those).
- **Optional questions** can be skipped — the setting keeps its default and can be changed later in `asc app settings` or in the app's settings on the platform.
- **Where the questions show up**: `AppService.InspectPackage` returns `settings_json` — the same `SettingsFile` JSON `GetAppSettings` carries — before the install (apps only; stacks have no questions), so the platform's install dialog shows the questionnaire while the install runs in the background. After the install the same questions arrive in `GetAppSettingsResponse.settings_json`. Answers are saved with the regular `SetAppSettings`. Installing an app still **does not start it** — starting after the answers is the caller's move.
- The CLI has no separate questionnaire: `asc app start` without answers to the required questions points at `asc app settings <id>`, where those settings are set.

#### 🔌 Environment group delivery (`$env`)

Alongside the reserved `$quota`/`$start_command`/`$backup` keys, `settings.json` accepts a fourth one: **`$env`** — an object of arbitrary `NAME: value` string pairs. It exists for the platform's Environment groups (org/project-scoped variable sets — [🌱 environments](https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-platform/blob/main/docs/features/environments.md)): a group connected to an app is resolved and merged by the platform, then written under this key the same way any other setting is, so it rides the same `settings.json` → apply-on-(re)start pipeline as everything above — no separate delivery channel.

```json
{ "$env": { "BOT_TOKEN": "…", "TZ": "Europe/Moscow" } }
```

- Names must match `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`; a malformed entry is rejected when the values are saved, like any other setting.
- **Precedence**: a package-declared setting with a matching `env:` key — and an actual value — always wins over a same-named `$env` entry. The user configured that value explicitly, in the app's own settings, which is a more specific and deliberate choice than an org/project-wide default. An `$env` entry with no matching package setting reaches the container env unconditionally.
- Not shown by `asc app settings`'s interactive editor (it is platform-managed) but preserved untouched by it, like any key the editor does not recognize.

### 📏 Resource quota (quota)

The `quota:` section of `asc.settings.yaml` limits the resources of one app instance (DMN-021):

```yaml
quota:
  max_cpu: 2        # CPU cores limit (0.5, 2, …)
  max_ram: 1G       # memory limit: 512M, 2G, … (binary units, like docker -m)
  max_disk: 10G     # disk usage limit
```

- The values are normalized at install/upgrade time and recorded in `meta.json`; `asc app info <id>` shows them (`quota: cpu ≤ 2, ram ≤ 1.0 GiB, …`).
- **Docker apps**: enforced at container creation through the Engine API (`NanoCpus`, `Memory`).
- **native/process apps**: recorded in `meta.json`; cgroup enforcement is a next increment.
- `max_disk` is recorded for every runtime; per-runtime disk enforcement (Docker storage-opt / fs quotas) arrives incrementally.
- **User overrides** (DMN-030): the `quota` category of `asc app settings` overrides individual fields on top of the package values (`'-'` resets a field back); the override lands in `settings.json` and applies through the container recreate on the next restart.

### ⚠️ Resource shortfall check and `--force` (DMN-099)

Before an install pulls or builds anything, the daemon compares the manifest's `requirements:` and the effective `quota:` against what the host actually has. A shortfall raises the typed `pkg::resources::RequirementsNotMet` error instead of running further — installing `cs2` (`requirements: { ram: 4G, disk: 80G, cpu: 2 }`) on a 1-core/1GiB node used to fail deep inside `docker create` with a raw Engine error (`Docker responded with status code 400: range of CPUs is from 0.01 to 1.00, as there are only 1 CPUs available`); now it fails immediately with `installing 'cs2' needs more than the host has right now: RAM 4.0 GiB > 0.9 GiB, disk 80.0 GiB > 14.0 GiB, CPU 2 > 1`.

- **What is compared**: RAM/disk against what is currently *free* on the host (other installed apps count against it, same rule `asc app start`'s own advisory check already uses); CPU against the host's **total** logical core count, not its current load — cores are not consumed the way RAM is, and total capacity is what predicts the Engine's own validation. The CPU figure is the higher of `requirements.cpu` and the effective `quota.max_cpu` — the quota is what actually reaches `NanoCpus`, so its overshoot matters even when `requirements.cpu` is unset entirely (a `quota:`-only package, e.g. one with no `requirements:` section at all, still trips the check).
- **`--force`** (`asc install <pkg> --force`, `InstallAppRequest.force`) skips the check and installs anyway. On the CLI, the interactive path prints what is short and asks "Install anyway at your own risk? [y/N]" instead of requiring the flag up front (non-interactive callers get the structured error and decide there).
- **The CPU quota is still capped to the host's total core count, `--force` or not.** A quota above `nproc` is not a risk a human can accept away — the Engine hard-rejects it — so the effective `NanoCpus` sent to `docker create` is silently clamped down to the host's own core count whenever it would otherwise exceed it, with a warning line (`asc install`'s live output, or the daemon's own log for a caller with no progress channel) naming the cap. RAM/disk are never clamped: nothing downstream enforces them against host capacity the way the Engine enforces CPU, so `--force` really does mean "install it your way."
- **API shape**: mirrors `LicenseRequired`'s license-consent shape field-for-field — `InstallAppResponse.requirements_not_met` (`RequirementsNotMetDetail{ app, shortages: [{ resource, need, have }] }`) instead of a gRPC error, so the platform's install dialog renders its own "not enough resources, install anyway?" screen and retries with `force = true`, the same round trip license consent already uses.

- **The same ceiling at start and on clone** (DMN-133): the `pkg::refresh` drift check that recreates the container before `start`/`restart`, and `asc app clone`, cap the quota to the host's core count too (`resources::host_cores()`, no metrics sampling). The cap used to apply at install only — at start the desired configuration was read uncapped, drifted from the container and recreated it into that very 400, so an app installed "anyway" could never start again.

### 🚀 The start command (start_command)

The application's start command is configured in `asc.settings.yaml`. The string can **interpolate the package's environment variables** — `${VAR}` syntax:

```yaml
start_command: "steamcmd +force_install_dir /data +login anonymous +app_update ${STEAM_APP_ID} validate +quit"
```

- The substitution is performed by the daemon at install/upgrade time from the app's env — the setting values with `env:` keys, defaults included. An unresolved variable fails the install naming the variable.
- **Docker apps**: the command replaces what the image would run (the entrypoint becomes `/bin/sh -c`, so arguments and quoting work as in a shell).
- **native apps**: the command overrides `runtime.start` from `asc.yaml`.
- Interpolation resolves `${VAR}` against the app's whole computed environment — the setting values with `env:` keys **and** any `$env` entries from a connected Environment group (see above) — so a start command can reference a group-delivered variable too, as long as it was written to `settings.json` before the (re)start that recomputes the command. A UI preview of the computed command on the platform is a next increment ([🌱 environments](https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-platform/blob/main/docs/features/environments.md)).
- **User override** (DMN-030): the `start_command` category of `asc app settings` replaces the package's command for this instance (`'-'` resets back); `${VAR}` references resolve from the settings env when the override is applied.

### 🐳 install/update scripts: native or docker

A package's `install` and `update` scripts can run **either natively on the host or in docker** — controlled by the `run_in` field in the manifest's `scripts:` block:

```yaml
scripts:
  install:
    run: ./scripts/install.sh
    run_in: native            # native | docker
  update:
    run: ./scripts/update.sh
    run_in: docker            # a one-off container
    image: debian:12          # the image for docker execution (optional)
```

- `native` — the script runs on the host as the application's user.
- `docker` — the script runs in a one-off container with the `/asc/apps/<id>/` directory mounted (isolating build dependencies from the host).
- By default `run_in` inherits the package `type`: `docker` → docker, `native`/`utility` → native.

### Installation mechanics: cloning the repository

Installing an application = **cloning its repository**:

1. `asc install <package>` → the daemon clones the package repository into `/asc/apps/<id>/repository/`.
2. **Application versions = git tags** (GitHub tags), read from the **repository**, not the registry (DMN-047): installing a specific version — `asc install <package>@1.2.0` (tag checkout); `asc install <package>` with no version resolves the repository's **newest tag** via `git ls-remote` (no tags → the default branch HEAD); `asc install <package>@` (a bare `@`) lists the repository's tags and branches for an interactive pick (DMN-048), or, non-interactively, returns the available versions as an error. Updating — `asc app upgrade <name>` (checkout of the new tag). The registry index therefore carries **no version field** — a package's versions are whatever its repository is tagged with. API callers get the same tag list without any of that — `AppService.ListAppVersions` (DMN-0XX) takes a raw git URL and returns its tags (newest first) plus which one is `latest`, one `git ls-remote` round trip, no install/clone: what the platform's version picker (install wizard, upgrade dropdown) calls.
3. **License consent** (DMN-028, DMN-032, DMN-091): when the cloned package ships a license (`LICENSE.md` / `LICENSE` / `LICENSE.txt`), the CLI shows where the package comes from (registry source + repository), prints the license text and asks for acceptance — declining aborts the install and leaves nothing behind. The license is looked up in the **package's own directory** first (a monorepo package may ship its own license), falling back to the repository root. Non-interactive input accepts automatically with a printed notice. API callers get the same fields (`package`, `source`, `git`, `license`) structurally rather than as prose, but not the same way on every transport: the local REST API (the CLI's own unix-socket transport) returns them as a `license_required` field on a `409` error response; over gRPC (`AppService.InstallApp`/`InstallAppStream`, what the platform uses) it is **not an error at all** — `InstallAppResponse` carries an optional `license_required` message instead of `id`/`version`, since the call otherwise succeeded and just needs one more round trip with `license_ack = true`. The platform UI renders its own consent dialog from those fields either way. A stack asks once per repository. Packages without a license file install without the prompt.
4. **Custom name and multiple instances** (DMN-024, DMN-033): in a terminal `asc install` asks for an application name — Enter keeps the default, any other input becomes the app's name. Non-interactively, pass `--name "My Server"`. Installing a package that is already installed no longer fails: it becomes a **new instance** with the next free id (`<package>-2`, `<package>-3`, …), which also becomes its `custom_name` unless `--name` overrides it. The name is stored in `meta.json` (`custom_name`), must be unique among the user's apps, survives upgrades, and every command accepts it interchangeably with the id. A suffixed instance records the registry package it came from (`meta.package`), so `asc app upgrade` keeps resolving it correctly.
5. **Names are case-insensitive, ids are lowercase** (DMN-059): an app id becomes a directory, a container name and a systemd unit, so it is restricted to `[a-z0-9_-]` — but nothing about that is the user's problem. Wherever a name is *derived* (the repository name of a direct URL install, the registry entry name, the `name:` of `asc.yaml` / `asc.stack.yaml`) it is folded into that shape: `HOMEBAR` installs as `homebar`, `Home.Bar` as `home-bar`. Wherever a name is *typed* it is matched case-insensitively — `asc install HOMEBAR`, `asc install mystack/MyApp`, `asc app start HOMEBAR` and `asc app logs homebar` all reach the same app. A repository that only survives an install if its author renames it is a bug, not a rule.
6. From then on the daemon works with the local copy: reads `asc.yaml`/`asc.settings.yaml`, builds/launches according to the application type.
7. For Docker applications the container is created through the Engine API; an image missing on the host is **pulled automatically** from its registry (`runtime.image`; a name without a tag means `latest`) — both at install and at upgrade.
8. **Progress bars**: on a terminal, the repository clone (`git clone --progress`) and a Docker image pull both render as live bars (`docker pull`/`docker-compose pull` style — one bar per image layer) — on by default, independent of `asc config debug`. Non-interactive callers (piped output, the daemon API) get none of this; the same events are always available as `debug`-level tracing (`asc config debug on`). **API callers that want live progress instead** (DMN-090) use `AppService.InstallAppStream` — the same install as unary `InstallApp`, but as a server-streamed sequence of `InstallAppEvent`: a `line` event per step (the same text a terminal's bars are drawn from, not the redrawn bar itself) as they happen, ending in one `result` event with the same payload `InstallApp` would have returned (license-required included, see above), or, for a genuine failure, the stream ending in error. **A closed stream cancels the install** (DMN-137): that is how the platform cancels a task. The work stops at the next checkpoint — the `git clone` process is killed (git reports progress several times a second, so the wait is short), an image pull or BuildKit build is abandoned (the Engine aborts a pull/solve whose client went away), and there are checks after the clone and before the container is created; the half-made app directory is removed by the same guard that cleans up any failed install. Once the container exists there is nothing left to cancel and the install runs to completion. The outcome is a typed `Cancelled` error (gRPC `CANCELLED`). `UpgradeAppStream` and `RepullAppStream` cancel the same way, and `CloneAppStream` stops between copied files (the half-made copy is removed). The unary `InstallApp` still finishes an install whose request went away. The `app.install.cancel` capability in `GetStatus` says the daemon supports this.

**Reading a package without cloning it** (DMN-131): `AppService.InspectPackage` — what the platform's install dialog calls before installing anything — never downloads the package content. It takes a **sparse, blobless snapshot**: `git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --no-checkout` fetches the tip commit and its trees only (a file listing, no contents), `core.sparseCheckout` limits the working tree to the files a package is read from — `asc.yaml`, `asc.stack.yaml`, `asc.settings.yaml` (plus a custom `settings:` path, fetched on demand), `LICENSE*` of the package directory and the repository root, and what the install-method detector looks at (compose files, `Dockerfile*`, `Chart.yaml`, YAML up to three levels deep) — and `git read-tree -mu HEAD` fetches just those blobs in one batch. A repository with gigabytes of assets costs a few kilobytes per inspect. `core.sparseCheckout` with `.git/info/sparse-checkout` is used rather than `git sparse-checkout set --no-cone`, which needs git 2.35 — older than what Debian 11 / Ubuntu 20.04 ship. A server without partial-clone support ignores the filter and sends the blobs anyway: the snapshot degrades to the old shallow clone, it never fails because of it. Private repositories go through the same credentials (`asc auth`), including for the lazy blob fetch. The same read answers the two questions an install used to discover only by **failing a first run**: `InspectPackageResponse.license` carries the license text the install will ask consent for (the same fields as `license_required`), and `requirements_not_met` the resource shortfall on this host right now (the check `InstallApp` runs without `force`, run ahead of it — the first non-optional stack member that does not fit). The installer asks both up front and starts the one real install with `license_ack`/`force` already decided. A direct git install uses the same snapshot to tell an app from a stack before its one full clone, instead of cloning as an app first and restarting as a stack.

**Requirements at start** (DMN-029): the manifest's `requirements` (`ram`, `disk`, `cpu`) are compared with what the host has free when the app starts. When short, `asc app start` warns with the exact figures and — in a terminal — asks whether to start anyway at the user's own risk; non-interactive callers get the warning on stderr and proceed. The check is advice, not enforcement: read failures never block the start.

**Updating** (`asc app upgrade <name>[@version]`, synonym — `asc upgrade`): the application must be stopped; the new tag is cloned **next to** the current copy (`repository.new`), the manifest is validated, and only then are the directories swapped and the runtime recreated (for Docker the container is recreated with the new image). A failure before the swap does not touch the installed application; a failure while recreating the runtime rolls back to the previous version. Without an explicit version, the repository's newest tag is used (DMN-047); a registry package with no tags cannot be upgraded without an explicit `@version`. Already being on the requested (or newest) version is reported as such, not as a fake upgrade. **Over the API** (DMN-0XX/NODE-022), `AppService.UpgradeApp` mirrors `InstallApp` — `spec` is the app id, optionally `@version` — and `UpgradeAppStream` mirrors `InstallAppStream` exactly (a `line` event per step, ending in the same result `UpgradeApp` would have returned): the daemon still requires the app to be stopped first, so the platform's facade stops it, streams the upgrade, and restarts it if it was running — the daemon itself does not orchestrate that.

**Where the new version comes from** (DMN-053): a registry app resolves its package through the registries again (preferring the source it was installed from), while an app installed straight from a repository URL is re-resolved from **that URL** — `meta.source` (`"git:<url>"`) is the only origin it has, and no registry is consulted. Such an app moves tag by tag like any other, with two exceptions that follow a **moving ref** instead: one installed with `--branch` keeps following that branch (recorded as `meta.branch`), and one whose repository has no tags at all follows its default branch. For those the upgrade re-clones the ref and compares the fetched commit with the installed one — the same commit means "already up to date", a moved branch means an upgrade whose version is the branch name (or, for an untagged repository, the version the new manifest declares). An explicit `@version` always wins and pins the app to that tag, branch or not.

**Through the daemon** (DMN-053): with the system daemon running, `asc upgrade` goes through its unix socket like the lifecycle commands — the daemon owns the app tree, so an app installed into the system tree is upgradable without sudo. The clone uses the credentials of the **calling** user (DMN-062, see **Credentials** below), and the interactive auth-setup prompt works on that path exactly as it does in-process.

**Direct install from a git repository** (`asc install <url> [--branch <name>|--tag <name>] [--path <subdir>]`, DMN-040): when the spec is a git URL (`https://`, `ssh://`, or the scp-like `git@host:path`) rather than a package name, the daemon skips the registry entirely and clones the repository straight in — the same clone/manifest/provision pipeline as a registry install, minus the resolution step. `asc.yaml` is looked up at the repository root by default; `--path <subdir>` (DMN-096) says where to find the manifest inside the clone instead — the same idea as a registry entry's `source.path`, just with no entry to resolve it for the caller. `--branch`/`--tag` pick the ref to check out; neither flag clones the default branch HEAD. The app id defaults, with `--path` set, to the path's own last segment folded to a canonical lowercase id (`asc install https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-example-apps --path web/helloworld` installs as `helloworld`, not `asc-example-apps`), otherwise the repository's own name (`bar` for both `https://github.com/foo/bar.git` and `git@github.com:foo/bar`, `homebar` for `https://github.com/mireblood/HOMEBAR`, see point 5 above); `--name` overrides the id either way. The path is recorded in `meta.json` (`repo_path`) and survives `asc app upgrade` — without it, upgrading a monorepo package would break the same way installing one without `--path` used to. Private repositories reuse the exact same `asc auth` credentials below — a URL install is just a registry install with the resolution step removed. `asc upgrade` re-resolves apps installed this way from the recorded URL (DMN-053, see **Updating** above): a tag install moves to the repository's newest tag, a `--branch` install follows its branch. Re-running `asc install` with the same URL still creates a new instance rather than upgrading in place — that is what a second instance is for.

  The same field is available to API callers: the platform installs custom-registry packages exactly this way — the package's bare git URL, not its name through the daemon's own registry (so the install does not depend on whether the organization's registry happens to be configured on that particular node) — and before DMN-096 installing any monorepo package (several apps in one repository, as in `asc-example-apps`) from the platform failed outright: `path` was dropped at the `InstallAppRequest` boundary, so the daemon looked for `asc.yaml` at the clone root and named the app after the repository. `InstallAppRequest.path` (both unary `InstallApp` and streamed `InstallAppStream`) is that same field — the CLI flag's wire equivalent, carried as its own argument rather than folded into the spec string.

**Credentials** (DMN-045/046): one per-user store holds authorization both for private **repositories** (`git clone`) and for private image **registries** (the Engine pull), told apart by a `type` field (`repo` | `registry`). Entries are keyed **per host or prefix** (`github.com/myorg`, `ghcr.io/myorg`) and stored separately from the source lists, as JSON: `/etc/asc/auth.json` (root) and `~/.asc/auth.json` (user, alongside the rest of the per-user DMN-041 tree), both files 0600. Secrets end up neither in world-readable files nor in the argv of git processes (argv is visible to all users via /proc). The two scopes are independent: a regular user cannot open the root store at all — that is the point of 0600 in root-owned `/etc/asc` — so for them it simply contributes no credentials, and `asc auth add` (like every other unprivileged command) works on `~/.asc/auth.json` alone; editing the system store takes `sudo`.

```json
{
  "credentials": [
    { "type": "repo",     "pattern": "github.com/myorg", "token": "ghp_xxx" },
    { "type": "registry", "pattern": "ghcr.io/myorg", "username": "me", "token": "ghp_yyy" },
    { "type": "repo",     "pattern": "github.com/myorg/secret-app", "app": "6f8a…uuid", "key": "/home/me/.ssh/id_ed25519" }
  ]
}
```

- **Types**: `repo` authorizes a git clone — a token for `https://` URLs (via `GIT_ASKPASS` + an environment variable of the git process) or an SSH key for `git@`/`ssh://` URLs (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with `-i <key> -o IdentitiesOnly=yes`). **The URL follows the credential** (DMN-059): a credential only authorizes the transport it belongs to, so cloning `https://github.com/org/app` with an SSH key configured for that host goes over ssh instead (`git@github.com:org/app.git`), and an ssh URL with a token configured goes over https. Without that rewrite the configured credential would simply be ignored and the clone would fail as if nothing had been set up. `registry` authorizes an image pull — a **token plus username**, sent to the Docker Engine as the `X-Registry-Auth` header (the Engine, not the daemon, then contacts the registry, so no TLS stack is needed daemon-side). A registry entry rejects an SSH key and requires `--username`.
- **App binding** (`app`, DMN-044): a credential may be scoped to a single application by its uuid or id (`--app`), so a token serves exactly the app that needs it and no other. An app-bound entry is invisible to every other app and beats an equally specific unbound one for its own app; leaving `app` unset applies the credential to every app whose URL/image matches the pattern. Matching otherwise follows the same rule for both types: the longest prefix at a path boundary wins, and user entries take priority over system ones. Patterns match **case-insensitively** (DMN-059) — host names are case-insensitive by definition and the forges treat owner/repository names the same way, so a key added for `github.com/MyOrg` authorizes a clone of `github.com/myorg/app` and the other way round.
- **Detection**: git always runs with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` and `BatchMode=yes` — cloning a private repository without configured authorization does not hang on a password prompt but fails with a recognizable error (including the "Repository not found" that GitHub returns for private repositories without access). A private image pull surfaces the Engine's own authorization error. An ssh clone against a host missing from the `known_hosts` of the user running `asc` (root, for the daemon) fails the same way — `BatchMode` has no "continue connecting?" prompt to offer — so that error carries the `ssh-keyscan <host> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` fix with it (DMN-059).
- **Interactive setup**: on detecting a private repository, the CLI in a terminal **asks permission** to configure authorization right away: for ssh — a pick from the private keys found in `~/.ssh`, for https — a token, or that same key picker when the user has keys and chooses it (the clone then switches to the ssh transport, see **Types**); the choice is saved and the installation retries automatically. Under `sudo` the keys offered are the **invoking** user's, taken from their home in the user database rather than from `$HOME` (which distributions rewrite inconsistently). A non-interactive call (API, scripts) gets a structured error with an `asc auth add ...` hint.
- **Interactive setup through the daemon** (DMN-062): the prompt is not limited to the in-process path. When the install runs through the daemon — which is the normal case, `asc install` reaches for the socket first — a private repository comes back as a **structured** `auth_required` (HTTP 409 with `{"auth_required": {"url": …}}`, deliberately not 401, which on the TCP listener belongs to the API bearer token), the CLI reconstructs the same typed error the in-process clone raises, runs the same prompt, and retries. So `asc install https://github.com/<user>/<private-repo>` offers the key/token choice, writes it to `asc auth`, and installs — in one command, without a separate `asc auth add` round.
- **Whose credentials the daemon uses** (DMN-062): the daemon runs as root, so on its own it would only ever see `/etc/asc/auth.json` — and a regular user cannot write that file, which would make the prompt above pointless without `sudo`. Instead the daemon resolves credentials **on behalf of the caller**: the peer uid (SO_PEERCRED, or the attributed `SUDO_UID` for a root peer) yields that user's home from the user database, and their `~/.asc/auth.json` is read as a higher-priority list on top of the system store. An SSH-key entry coming from a user store must point at a key **owned by that user** — the daemon would otherwise open it as root, and a hand-edited `~/.asc/auth.json` pointing at `/root/.ssh/id_ed25519` must not turn into a way to clone with root's key; foreign and unreadable keys are ignored with a warning in the journal. Registry credentials for image pulls still come from the system store alone.
- **Migration**: the pre-DMN-045 TOML files (`/etc/asc/git-auth.toml`, `~/.config/asc/git-auth.toml`) are still read when no JSON store exists — their entries have no `type` and load as `repo` — and are migrated to `auth.json` on the next `asc auth` write, so configured auth keeps working across the upgrade.
- **CLI**: `asc auth add <host|prefix> [--type repo|registry] --token <token> [--username <user>] [--app <uuid|id>]` · `asc auth add <host> --ssh-key [path]` (without a path — an interactive key picker) · `asc auth list` (types and methods without secrets) · `asc auth remove <host> [--type repo|registry]`.
- **`CredentialService` (DMN-084/DMN-087)**: the same store, managed by API instead of the CLI — this is how the platform pushes an organization's registry credentials onto a node without ever running `asc auth add` over SSH. `ListCredentials`/`UpsertCredential`/`RemoveCredential` operate on the **system store only** (`/etc/asc/auth.json`) — a user's own `~/.asc/auth.json` stays exclusively under the CLI. `UpsertCredential` carries exactly the same `(kind, pattern, app)` upsert semantics as `GitAuth::add` above — calling it again with the same triple replaces the secret, token-for-token or key-for-key alike.
  - **Two secret shapes.** `UpsertCredential`'s `secret` is either a token, or (DMN-087) raw PEM-encoded (OpenSSH or PKCS8) private-key bytes. For a key, the daemon is the one deriving a file for it — `/etc/asc/ssh-keys/<hash of (kind, pattern, app)>.pem` (`$ASC_SSH_KEY_STORE` overrides the directory), created with 0600 permissions from the moment it exists, never `write` followed by a `chmod` — and registers a `Method::SshKey` pointing at it, exactly the shape `asc auth add --ssh-key` produces by hand. Repeating the call for the same `(kind, pattern, app)` overwrites that same file in place; replacing an ssh-key credential with a token, or removing it outright (`RemoveCredential`), deletes the file too — nothing is left behind pointing at a secret that no longer has a live entry. PEM validation is shallow (a `PRIVATE KEY` marker check) — a malformed key surfaces as an ordinary git/ssh error at clone time, the same as a hand-configured key would.
  - Advertised as the separate `"ssh-credentials"` capability (`GetStatus`, DMN-076) — a platform build talking to an older daemon can still push token credentials while treating an ssh-key one as unsupported instead of hitting `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
  - `ListCredentials` returns the same "type, pattern, method label" shape the CLI's `list` prints — never the secret itself, key file included.
  - **Ownership marker** (`managed_by`, DMN-110): `ReplaceSources` fully replaces the source list, but `UpsertCredential`/`RemoveCredential` are individual calls — nothing ever told the daemon "this is everything the platform wants, delete what's missing", so a credential deleted on the platform used to stay in `auth.json` forever. `UpsertCredentialRequest.managed_by` (and `CredentialSummary.managed_by` on the way back) lets a caller stamp its own entries — the platform pushes `"platform"` — and `RemoveCredentialRequest.managed_by`, when set, narrows a removal to entries carrying that exact marker. A push can now list its own credentials, diff them against what it just sent, and remove the leftovers **without ever touching an entry the operator added by hand** through `asc auth add` (which never sets the marker) — even one that happens to share the same `(kind, pattern)` under a different `app` binding. `asc auth list` prints `managed_by=<value>` next to any entry that carries one.

### Several applications in one repository: asc.stack.yaml

**The root rule**: a package repository may contain any number of `asc.yaml` files in subdirectories, but its root must hold **exactly one** manifest — either `asc.yaml` (a single application) or `asc.stack.yaml` (a stack) that ties all the nested `asc.yaml` files together. Nested manifests without a root one are not indexed.

The `asc.stack.yaml` stack manifest lists the applications and the paths to their `asc.yaml` files:

```yaml
name: my-stack
version: 1.0.0
description: "..."
apps:
  - name: web
    path: ./web            # the directory with asc.yaml
  - name: worker
    path: ./worker
  - name: db
    path: ./db
    optional: true          # an optional stack component
```

- `asc install my-stack` — install the whole stack; `asc install my-stack/web` — just one application from it.
- **Renaming a stack at install** (DMN-034): `asc install my-stack --name prod` is a **prefix** applied to every installed app — `prod-web`, `prod-worker`, `prod-db` — since a stack has no entity of its own, only its member apps. `asc install my-stack/web --name prod-web` names just the requested app, as for a single-app install.
- A stack can declare dependencies between applications (`depends_on` — the startup order); components can be `optional`. Environment variables live in each app's own `asc.settings.yaml`.
- Registries and the platform store index both single `asc.yaml` files and `asc.stack.yaml` stacks.
- Examples — in the [asc-example-apps](https://github.com/AdminServiceCloud/asc-example-apps) repository.

**Stack install mechanics**: the repository is cloned **once** — to read `asc.stack.yaml` and as the source of every member (DMN-131): each selected application installs like a regular app, with its own copy of that clone under `/asc/apps/<id>/repository/`, its own directory and meta.json, but without fetching the repository again:

- **The app id** is the `name` from the app's own `asc.yaml` (in the example above the stack's `web` app may be named `my-stack-web`); the origin is recorded in meta.json as `package: "my-stack/web"` — `asc app upgrade` resolves the package through it.
- **Order**: dependencies (`depends_on`) install first; cycles are rejected at validation. `asc install my-stack` installs every non-`optional` component; `asc install my-stack/db` installs the requested component (even an `optional` one) plus its dependencies.
- **Repeat installs**: a wanted app (the one(s) requested, not a dependency pulled in alongside them) that is already installed becomes a **new instance** (DMN-033) instead of being skipped; a dependency that is already installed is still reused, not duplicated. Every app installs atomically (a failure removes only its own directory, previously installed components stay).
- **License consent** is asked once per repository (one repo = one license), not per stack app.

**A stack installed straight from a git URL** (DMN-097): a registry entry declares its `type` (`app` or `stack`), a bare URL declares nothing — so `asc install <url> [--path <subdir>]` finds out from the clone. When the package directory holds `asc.stack.yaml` instead of `asc.yaml`, the install restarts as a stack install and puts every non-`optional` app on the machine, exactly as `asc install my-stack` would; `--app <name>` installs one app of the stack instead (the direct-install equivalent of the registry's `<stack>/<app>` spec — a URL cannot carry that slash), and `--name` is the same prefix it is for a registry stack. Each app records the repository in `meta.source` and **its own** manifest subdirectory in `meta.repo_path` (`gameservers/cs2/server`, not the stack root), so `asc app upgrade` afterwards reads the app manifest and not `asc.stack.yaml`. The stack itself is recorded too (DMN-121): `meta.package = "<stack>/<app>"`, the stack named like the install itself — after the manifest subdirectory, or the repository when the stack sits at its root — so `asc stacks` and the platform group a git-installed stack the same way as one from a registry; upgrades still go by `source` and `repo_path`. A registry entry that mislabels a stack as `type: app` now says so (`package 'cs2' is a stack of 2 app(s) (server, master), not a single application`) instead of failing with `cannot read manifest .../asc.yaml: No such file or directory`.

> ⚠️ This is what the platform's install dialog relies on: it installs every registry package by its git URL + `path` rather than by registry spec, so before DMN-097 a `type: stack` package (e.g. `cs2`) could not be installed from the UI at all.

**Reading a package without installing it** (`InspectPackage`, DMN-098): what a repository actually ships — one app (`asc.yaml`) or a stack (`asc.stack.yaml`) with its apps, their install ids, `depends_on`, `optional` flags and declared `requirements`. The daemon clones the repository shallowly into a temporary directory, reads the manifests and deletes the clone: nothing is installed and no app directory is created. An installer UI calls it before the install so the operator sees that a package is a stack and which apps it is about to put on the node — the registry index carries the package type but never the stack's contents, and a direct URL install has no registry entry at all. gRPC only (`AppService.InspectPackage`); the CLI shows the same thing by installing or by reading the repository.

**Detecting every installation method a repository supports** (`pkg::detect`, DMN-106): before this, `InspectPackage` on a repository with no `asc.yaml`/`asc.stack.yaml` simply failed — `Manifest::load` errors out on a missing file, and that error propagated all the way to the caller as "cannot read manifest". A repository with a `Dockerfile` or a `docker-compose.yml` and nothing else is common enough on GitHub that this made the install dialog's "point at a repository" path far less useful than it should be. `InspectPackage` no longer fails on a missing manifest: it reports back `PACKAGE_KIND_UNSPECIFIED` and whatever `pkg::detect::detect` found in the package directory, so the caller can say "found, not installable yet" instead of treating the repository as unrecognized.

- **What is detected, in table order**: `asc.stack.yaml` and `asc.yaml` (already installable); a compose file (`compose.yml(.yaml)`/`docker-compose.yml(.yaml)` at the package root, then one level into `deploy/`, `docker/`, `.docker/`); a Swarm stack (`docker-stack.yml(.yaml)`, or the same compose file when any service declares a `deploy:` block, or a top-level `x-swarm` key — a compose file with `deploy:` reports **both** `DOCKER_COMPOSE` and `SWARM`, since it is one file usable two ways); a `Dockerfile` (at the root first, then a bounded walk for `Dockerfile*`, installable since DMN-107); Kubernetes (`k8s/`, `kubernetes/`, `manifests/`, `deploy/k8s/` directories, or any `.yml`/`.yaml` file whose first 4 KiB contain both `apiVersion:` and `kind:`); a Helm chart (`Chart.yaml` containing both `apiVersion:` and `name:`). Each detected method reports `supported` (`asc.yaml`/`asc.stack.yaml`/`Dockerfile`; `docker_compose` joins in DMN-108) and, when not, a plain-English `unsupported_reason` — this is API data for the platform's own localized UI, not CLI output, so it does not go through the daemon's i18n system.
- **Compose is parsed permissively.** Unlike `asc.yaml`/`asc.settings.yaml`, where `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` is deliberate — it catches a typo in *our own* format — a compose file is a large, foreign format with a huge surface. Rejecting on an unrecognized key would turn "detected" into "failed to parse" for any file using a compose feature this daemon doesn't model.
- **The filesystem walk is bounded**: depth 3, a shared budget of ~5,000 entries across the whole walk, skipping `.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `target`, `dist`. A Kubernetes manifest is matched by reading only the first 4 KiB of each candidate file, never the whole thing.
- **A private repository is a normal response field, not a bare error.** `git_clone` already raised the typed `pkg::auth::AuthRequired` on a failed clone, but `api::grpc::to_status` had no downcast for it, so it fell through to a raw `Status::internal` with the message inside — the platform had no way to tell "this repository is private" from any other clone failure over gRPC (the REST/CLI paths already handled this correctly, see **Credentials** above). `InspectPackageResponse.auth_required` and `InstallAppResponse.auth_required` now carry it structurally instead — the same non-error, "one more round trip" shape `license_required`/`requirements_not_met` already use — with the URL, `pkg::auth::normalize(url)` (the pattern a credential must be configured for) and the transport (`https` or `ssh`, from `pkg::auth::is_ssh_url`) the caller needs to offer adding one.

**Installing straight from a bare Dockerfile** (`pkg::dockerfile`, DMN-107): a repository with a `Dockerfile` and nothing else now installs as a normal `type: docker` app — `InstallAppRequest.install_method = DOCKERFILE` (a direct git install only; a registry entry is always its own `asc.yaml`) synthesizes a `Manifest`/`SettingsFile` in memory instead of reading them from the repository, and the rest of the install (`enforce_install_policy`, the resource check, `provision`) runs completely unchanged on top of it.

- **The synthesized manifest** sets `runtime.image-build` from the detected Dockerfile (`context` = its directory, `dockerfile` = its filename, `tag` = `None` → the usual `asc-local/<id>:latest`) and a placeholder `version: "0.0.0"` — a bare Dockerfile carries no version of its own, so `AppMeta.version` is left unset (not "0.0.0") unless a tag was actually checked out; the real version tracking is `AppMeta.version`/`branch`, exactly as for any other direct git install.
- **`EXPOSE`/`VOLUME` become settings**, or the app would install successfully and publish nothing. A naive, line-based scan (no `ARG`/`ENV` expansion, Docker's own `\`-continuation honored) turns `EXPOSE <port>[/tcp|udp]` into one `type: ports` setting per protocol (`ports`/`ports_udp`), paired host↔container exactly like a hand-written `asc.settings.yaml`, and `VOLUME <path>` into one `type: volumes` setting — a single volume defaults to the shared `data/` folder like any other package, but a second and further one get their own `:volN` subfolder, or they would all silently collide into that same folder (`parse_volume`'s host-side default is a literal `"data"`, not per-path). A directive this doesn't understand is simply not counted, the same permissive stance `pkg::detect` already takes on compose.
- **Nothing synthesized is ever written to `repository/`.** Every later reader of an installed app's manifest — `refresh` (settings-drift recreate), `upgrade`, disk usage, ports, `asc app clone`, the settings editor — used to go straight to `Manifest::load`, which simply fails for a Dockerfile install (there is no `asc.yaml` to read). They all now go through `dockerfile::resolve_installed(meta, manifest_dir)`, which re-synthesizes identically from `AppMeta.install_method` (`Dockerfile { dockerfile: <path> }`, the exact file `pkg::detect` found at install time — re-detected, not reused, on upgrade, since the file may have moved between versions) or falls back to `Manifest::load` for every ordinary install. `settings::locate_installed` gets the matching fix on the read side: a Dockerfile install has no `asc.yaml` for its "repository root has the manifest" fast path to find, so it is checked first and routed straight to the recorded `repo_path`, before that path would otherwise mis-resolve the app as an unregistered package.
- **CLI**: `asc install <url> --method dockerfile` (`asc app install` has the same flag). Platform: `InstallAppRequest.install_method`/`InstallNodeAppRequest.install_method`, the lowercase spelling `DetectedInstallMethod.kind` already uses.

**Installing from a bare `docker-compose.yml`** (`pkg::compose`/`daemon::compose`/`apps::compose`, DMN-108/DMN-109): a repository with a compose file and nothing else installs as a `docker compose` project — an entirely different provisioning path from every other runtime kind, since there is no single container or manifest-driven `provision()` to run. `InstallAppRequest.install_method = DOCKER_COMPOSE` (direct git install only) skips the manifest pipeline completely: no settings, no quota, no requirements check — the compose file is the only source of truth, and the app's `Runtime::Compose { project, files, working_dir }` records exactly what to run it with.

- **Orchestrated through the `docker compose` CLI plugin (v2), never modeled on top of bollard.** Interpolation, `env_file`, anchors, `extends`, profiles, several override files, `depends_on` health waits, per-service networks with DNS aliases, `configs`/`secrets` — reimplementing this over the Engine API is a project of its own, and its failure mode would be silent wrongness on a real file, read as "ASC is broken" rather than "this compose feature isn't supported". `daemon::compose` shells out to the plugin instead, `DOCKER_HOST` pointed at the same configured socket bollard uses everywhere else in this daemon — the one deliberate, now-documented exception to "Docker only through bollard" (see `AGENTS.md`).
- **The plugin is optional and probed once, cached for the process** (`daemon::compose::available`): `docker compose version` against the configured socket, at first use rather than at startup, since a capability check should not slow down every daemon boot for a feature most installs never touch. Missing it leaves `docker_compose` a **detected, not installable** method — `DetectedInstallMethod.supported` for this one kind is the only one that is not a pure function of the kind itself, unlike Dockerfile/Swarm/Kubernetes/Helm.
- **Provisioning is `docker compose create`**, the exact compose equivalent of `docker_create`'s "created, not started" contract — an install leaves the project's containers materialized but stopped, same as every other runtime. `start`/`stop`/`logs`/`remove` (`apps::compose::ComposeDriver`) map to `up -d` / `stop` (**not** `down` — every other runtime's "stop" means "no longer running, still exists", and `down` would remove the containers and, with `-v`, the volumes the app's data lives in) / `logs` (already multiplexed and service-prefixed by the plugin itself) / `down --remove-orphans`. There is no settings-drift recreate step: a compose app has no `asc.settings.yaml` to drift from, and `up -d` is already idempotent against the compose file itself.
- **Ports come from the compose file, not the live Engine state** — the only way a *stopped* compose app still reports the ports it will bind, the same property every other runtime already has from its settings. Only the common short syntax (`"8080:80"`, `"80"`, `"127.0.0.1:8080:80"`, optionally `/udp`) is understood; an unrecognized shape is simply not counted, the same permissive stance `pkg::detect` takes on the rest of a compose file.
- **Interactive console (exec/attach) is not available** — a compose project has no single container for it to address, so both are refused with the app's kind named in the error, the exact same generic `Runtime::Docker { .. } => …, other => refuse` shape that already refuses them for systemd/process apps. The live WS-followed log view *is* available (`docker compose logs -f`, `console::logs_command`), unlike exec/attach — logs multiplex by service regardless of how many containers the project has.
- **The one check that matters most: no bind-mount escapes the package directory.** `pkg::compose::check_bind_mounts` refuses a compose file where any service's `volumes:` names a host path (short syntax with a `.`/`/`/`~`-prefixed source, or long syntax with `type: bind`) outside the cloned repository, before a single container is created from it — an arbitrary compose file is not audited the way an `asc.yaml` package is, and nothing else stops it from mounting `/` into a container. Deliberately conservative rather than exhaustively correct: a relative source is safe exactly when it has no `..` component (the compose file's own directory is always under the package directory to begin with), an absolute or `~`-relative one is refused outright — no bypass flag exists in this increment.
- **`asc app clone`/`asc app upgrade` refuse a compose app cleanly** rather than fail confusingly on a missing manifest — re-provisioning a whole compose project (a fresh project name and containers, or a re-cloned repository rebuilt in place) is separate, unstarted work, not a gap papered over with a manifest-shaped error.
- **`kind` needs no migration.** `Runtime::kind()` returning `"compose"` flows automatically through the existing free-text `App.kind` → `nodes.node_apps.kind` pipeline the platform already has for `"docker"`/`"systemd"`/`"process"` — nothing on the platform side pattern-matches this string exhaustively.

### Registries

- **Registry format** (the `registry` repo) — a hierarchy of JSON files: the root index `registry.json` → category files `categories/<topic>.json` (databases, ai, bots, game-servers, system-utilities, web…) → optional subcategories (`children`). Packages come in two kinds: `app` (asc.yaml) and `stack` (asc.stack.yaml). Validation schemas — in `registry/schema/`. Descriptions are in English.
- **Source tree**: the daemon's sourcelist → a tree is built from all registries (following the root index's `index`/`children` links), then a merged application list (per user); in search results name conflicts are resolved by source priority.
- **Name conflicts at install**: when several sources provide the requested package, `asc install` in a terminal lists the candidates (source name + repository) and asks which one to use (pick a number); non-interactive callers get an error with the same list — pin the registry explicitly: `asc install <pkg> --source <name>` (API: the `source` field of InstallAppRequest). `asc app upgrade` prefers the source the app was installed from.
- **Source types**: `file://` (a local directory) and `https://` (a registry, GitHub raw).
- **Fetch resilience** (DMN-036): each registry index file (`registry.json`, category files) is a separate `curl` invocation with no connection reuse between them — a whole `asc update`/`asc search` run is a short burst of several small HTTPS requests to the same host. A stalled connection on any one of them (CDN throttling, transient network hiccup) used to hang the whole command for up to 5 minutes with zero output. Registry fetches now use a short per-request timeout (20s) plus a couple of retries on transient errors, instead of the generous 300s budget reserved for large downloads (`asc-updater` release assets).
- **`asc update` progress** (DMN-037): on a terminal, every index file gets its own progress line, `docker pull`/`git clone` style — a spinner while the request is in flight, frozen on its byte count on success or the error on failure. Since the registry is fetched one small file at a time, this is what turns a stuck fetch into a visibly stuck spinner instead of a silent wait.
- **Per-user source lists**: two list levels —
  - **system** `/etc/asc/sources.toml` — managed by root (`sudo asc source add|remove`), the sources are visible to **all** users of the server;
  - **user** `~/.config/asc/sources.toml` — each user maintains their own list (`asc source add|remove` without sudo), which extends the system one.
  - The effective list = system sources (higher priority) + your own; a user cannot shadow or remove system sources (`asc source list` shows the origin of every source). Index caches: for root — in `data_dir`, for a user — in `~/.cache/asc/`.
- **Install policy** (`[policy]` in `/etc/asc/config.toml`, managed by root): `user_install = "all"` (default — users may install any packages: Docker, native, utilities) or `user_install = "docker"` (users may install Docker applications only; native apps and utilities are root-only). Applied at `asc install`; does not apply to root.
- **Index cache** with a TTL + `asc update` for a forced refresh.
- **CLI**: `asc install|remove|upgrade <pkg>` (or `asc install <git-url> [--branch|--tag] [--path <subdir>] [--app <stack app>] [--force]`), `asc search <query>`, `asc source add|remove|list`, `asc update`.
